# Overview

This manual outlines procedures for implementing a digital quality
measure (dQM) to assess cancer diagnostic quality. There are two main
measures.

1. Rate of cancers diagnosed as an emergency (outcome measure)
2. Rate of cancers diagnosed at advanced stage (outcome measure)

We focus mainly on lung and colorectal cancer, but the measures can be
adapted to other cancers. The code has support for some other cancers
(*e.g.,* prostate).




# Parameters

Defaults that we used in our initial development and validation
studies are listed in parentheses.

Cancer of Interest:
: The cancer being studied in a particular eMeasure (*e.g.,* lung,
colorectal).

Search Period Start:
: The date from which to search for Emergency Cancer Diagnoses
(2019-01-01).

Search Period duration:
: Length of time from `Search Period Start` over which the search will
be conducted (12 months).

Exclusion Period duration:
: Length of time prior to Search Period Start to look for previous
cancer records to exclude patients (50 years).

Lookback Period duration:
: Length of time an inpatient encounter must occur prior to a cancer
diagnosis to qualify the diagnosis as an emergency (30 days).

Prior History duration:
: Length of time prior to cancer diagnosis date for which the patient
needs to have previous records of being in the health system (730
days).

FIXME. Is he supposed to have only a visit $v$, with age of visit
$a_v$ that is more than the 3 years? Or must have visits before *and
within* 3 years?

$$\exists v (a_v > 3)$$

$$\exists v \exists w ([a_v > 3] \land [a_w \le 3])$$




# Denominator

- Retrieve all first-time cancer diagnoses in the Search Period for
the Cancer of Interest, using cancer registry entries[^option]. Select
only the earliest diagnosis date, for the given cancer, for the given
patient, in the Search Period.

[^option]: Initially we defined cancer diagnoses as cancer registry
**or** visit diagnostic codes (ICD-10). The current SQL code does this
but later filters these occurrences out. Our development and
validation work uses only cancer registry---not diagnostic codes---to
define new cancer diagnoses.




# Exclusions

These patients will appear in *neither* the numerator *nor* the
denominator.

- Using the same methodology (cancer registry) used to define as in
Step 1, exclude all patients with a cancer record in the exclusion
period, prior to the search period, for the cancer of Interest.

- Exclude any patient without recorded primary care encounters in
their health system within the Prior History period (to ensure that
the patients are enrolled in and active users of the health system
when the cancer could reasonably be found).




# EP Numerator

- Any of those in the denominator, with emergency dept visit and/or
**unplanned** inpatient admission, in the Lookback Period.




# Late stage numerator

- Any of those in the denominator, if the cancer is stage group III or
IV - FIXME Are unknown or stage not recorded *additionally* excluded
from the late stage numerator (or denominator??).

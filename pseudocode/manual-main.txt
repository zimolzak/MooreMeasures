% Digital Quality Measures of Cancer Diagnosis

# Overview

This manual outlines procedures for implementing a digital quality
measure (dQM) to assess cancer diagnostic quality. There are two main
measures.

1. Rate of cancers diagnosed as an emergency (outcome measure)
2. Rate of cancers diagnosed at advanced stage (outcome measure)

We focus mainly on lung and colorectal cancer, but the measures can be
adapted to other cancers. The code has support for some other cancers
(*e.g.,* prostate).




# Details FIXME

Include or not?? Also talks about missed test, not dqm.

> In general, the code proceeds by: 1. defining the red flags that
> warrant additional evaluation for cancer (often labs or imaging), 2.
> excluding other explanations for the red flags, such as already
> diagnosed colon cancer, or known cause of bleeding in the upper GI
> tract (often based on ICD/CPT codes),

> As an example, the e-trigger for colorectal cancer identifies
> patients with positive fecal blood tests or iron deficiency anemia,
> and then excludes patients with any of the following: advanced age,
> dece... These two e-triggers answer the question, "How do you find
> (in the database) patients who had a test that shows a possibility
> of cancer, but who have **not** had timely follow-up?" Further
> details about exactly what constitutes exclusion or follow-up can be
> found in the e-trigger manual appendices. Non-VA sites should
> consult these appendices, as well as SQL code in order to
> reimplement the e-triggers in local SQL.




# Parameters

Defaults that we used in our initial development and validation
studies are listed in parentheses.

Search Period Start:
: The date from which to search for Emergency
Cancer Diagnoses (2019-01-01).

Search Period duration:
: Length of time from `Search Period Start` over
which the search will be conducted (12 months).

Exclusion Period duration:
: Length of time prior to Search Period Start to look for
previous cancer records to exclude patients (50 years).

Lookback Period duration:
: Length of time an inpatient encounter must occur prior to a
cancer diagnosis to qualify the diagnosis as an emergency (30 days).

Prior History duration:
: Length of time prior to cancer diagnosis date for which
the patient needs to have previous records of being in the health
system (730 days).

FIXME. Is he supposed to have only a visit $v$, with age of visit
$a_v$ that is more than the 3 years? Or must have visits before *and
within* 3 years?

$$\exists v (a_v > 3)$$

$$\exists v \exists w ([a_v > 3] \land [a_w \le 3])$$




# Denominator

1. Retrieve all cancer records in the Search Period for the Cancer of
Study, using cancer registry entries[^option]. Select only the
earliest diagnosis date, for the given cancer, for the given patient,
in the Search Period.

[^option]: Initially we defined cancer diagnoses as cancer registry
**or** visit diagnostic codes (ICD-10). The current SQL code does this
but later filters these occurrences out. Our development and
validation work uses only cancer registry---not diagnostic codes---to
define new cancer diagnoses.

## Exclusions

These patients will appear in *neither* the numerator *nor* the
denominator.

1. Using the same methodology (cancer registry) used to define as in Step 1, exclude
all patients with a cancer record in the exclusion period, prior to
the search period, for the cancer of study.

2. Exclude any patient without recorded primary care encounters in their health
system within the Prior History period (to ensure that the patients are enrolled in and active
users of the health system when the cancer could reasonably be found).




# EP Numerator

Any of those in the denominator, with emergency dept visit and/or
unplanned[^appx] inpatient admission, in the
Lookback Period.

[^appx]: See appendix




# Late stage numerator



- Early-Stage Presentations: and the cancer is stage group I or II

- Late-Stage Presentations: and the cancer is stage group III or IV

FIXME Are unknown or stage not recorded *additionally* excluded from the late stage
numerator (or denominator??).




# Terminology

Cancer of Study:
: The cancer being studied in a particular eMeasure
(*e.g.,* lung, colorectal).

Diagnosis Event:
: A first-time discovery of the cancer of study.

Cancer Registry Entry:
: An entry in the cancer registry from which we
may infer a Diagnosis Event occurred.

First-Time Cancer Code Occurrence:
: The first occurrence of a
diagnostic code for a cancer in a patient's medical record, from which
we may infer a Diagnosis Event occurred.

Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event:
: Emergency care preceding the
Diagnosis Event that is related to some pre-diagnosis manifestation of
the cancer of study.

Emergency Cancer Diagnosis:
: A Diagnosis Event preceded by a
Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event within some Lookback Period.

Emergency Cancer Diagnosis Record:
: A record containing the following
fields:

    - Patient ID
    - Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event ID
    - Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event Start Date
    - Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event Location
    - Diagnosis Event ID
    - Diagnosis Event Start Date
    - Diagnosis Event Location


Prior History Period:
: The minimum period of time prior to a
Diagnosis Event for which a patient must have some documentation of
healthcare encounters within a health system to qualify as having a
history of receiving care from that health system.

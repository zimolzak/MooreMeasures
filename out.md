# Digital quality measures of cancer diagnosis

1. Rate of delayed cancer red flag follow-up (process measure)
2. Rate of cancers diagnosed as an emergency (outcome measure)
3. Rate of cancers diagnosed at advanced stage (outcome measure)

This repository currently focuses on measures 2 and 3 only. This
README file contains pseudocode for measure 2 (emergency presentation
of cancer).




# Terminology

-   Cancer of Study: The cancer being studied in a particular eMeasure.

-   Diagnosis Event: A first-time discovery of the cancer of study.

-   Cancer Registry Entry: An entry in the cancer registry from which we
    may infer a Diagnosis Event occurred.

-   First-Time Cancer Code Occurrence: The first occurrence of a
    diagnostic code for a cancer in a patient's medical record, from
    which we may infer a Diagnosis Event occurred.

-   Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event: Emergency care preceding the
    Diagnosis Event that is related to some pre-diagnosis manifestation
    of the cancer of study.

-   Emergency Cancer Diagnosis: A Diagnosis Event preceded by a
    Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event within some Lookback Period.

-   Emergency Cancer Diagnosis Record: A record containing the following
    fields:

    -   Patient ID

    -   Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event ID

    -   Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event Start Date

    -   Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event Location

    -   Diagnosis Event ID

    -   Diagnosis Event Start Date

    -   Diagnosis Event Location

-   Search Period Start: The date from which to search for Emergency
    Cancer Diagnoses.

-   Search Period Length: Length of time from
    $\text{Search\ Period\ Start}$ over which the search will be
    conducted.

-   Search Period: The range of dates encompassed by
    $Search\ Period\ Start + Search\ Period\ Length$ over which the
    search is conducted.

-   Exclusion Period Length: Length of time prior to
    $\text{Search\ Period\ Start}$ over which diagnostic data will be
    collected for each patient to exclude them from the study if they
    have a prior cancer diagnosis.

-   Exclusion Period: The range of dates encompassed by
    $Search\ Period\ Start - Exclusion\ Period\ Length$ over which data
    for exclusion is collected.

-   Lookback Period Length: The period of time prior to each Diagnosis
    Event over which a Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event may occur.

-   Lookback Period: The range of dates encompassed by
    $Diagnosis\ Event\ Start\ Date - Lookback\ Period\ Length$ over
    which a Pre-Diagnosis Emergency Care Event may occur for each
    Diagnosis Event.

-   Potential Lookback Search Period: The range of dates encompassed by
    $Search\ Period\ Start - Lookback\ Period\ Length$ to
    $Search\ Period\ Start + Search\ Period\ Length$.

-   Search Region: The geographic region within a health system over
    which a search is conducted.

-   Prior History Period: The minimum period of time prior to a
    Diagnosis Event for which a patient must have some documentation of
    healthcare encounters within a health system to qualify as having a
    history of receiving care from that health system.




# Parameters

1.  Set up Parameters

    a.  Search Period Start = 2019-01-01

    b.  Search Period Length = 12 months

    c.  Exclusion Period Length = -50 years (Length of time prior to
        Search Period Start to look for previous cancer records to
        exclude patients)

    d.  Lookback Period Length = -30 days (Length of time an inpatient
        encounter must occur prior to a cancer diagnosis to qualify the
        diagnosis as an emergency)

    e.  Prior History Period = 730 days (Length of time prior to cancer
        diagnosis date for which the patient needs to have previous
        records of being in the health system)




# Numerator

## Inclusion

1.  Get a list of all cancer records in the Search Period for the Cancer
    of Study. This includes (a) Cancer Registry Entries as well as (b)
    diagnostic code occurrences for the Study Cancer (*this part is
    optional -- the current code does this but later filters these
    occurrences out as we are not currently using them to determine
    cancer incidence*).

2.  Using the same methodology as in Step 1, get a list of all cancer
    records in the exclusion period prior to the search period for the
    cancer of study.

3.  Remove all cancer records from Step 1 for patients that were also
    identified in the cancer records in Step 2.

4.  From Step 3, add Cancer Registry Entries to a table (select only the
    earliest for any given type of cancer for any given patient). Then,
    for patients from Step 3 that do not have cancer registry entries,
    add the First-Time Diagnostic Code occurrences to that table by
    selecting only the earliest diagnostic code occurrences from Step 3.
    This table now contains the collection of Diagnosis Events within
    the study parameters.

5.  Select for all potential emergency care events in the Potential
    Lookback Search Period. This table now contains the collection of
    Emergency Care Events within the study parameters.

6.  Select for dyads of Diagnosis Events and Emergency Care Events for
    each patient such that the Emergency Care Event falls within the
    lookback period for the Diagnosis Event.

## Exclusion

1.  From Step 6, select only records for patients who've had previous
    records in the health system for at least the Prior History Period
    (to ensure that the patients are "enrolled" in the health system).




# Denominator

## Inclusion

1.  Get a list of all cancer records in the Search Period for the Cancer
    of Study. This includes (a) Cancer Registry Entries as well as (b)
    diagnostic code occurrences for the Study Cancer (*this part is
    optional -- the current code does this but later filters these
    occurrences out as we are not currently using them to determine
    cancer incidence*).

2.  Using the same methodology as in Step 1, get a list of all cancer
    records in the exclusion period prior to the search period for the
    cancer of study.

3.  Remove all cancer records from Step 1 for patients that were also
    identified in the cancer records in Step 2.

4.  From Step 3, add Cancer Registry Entries to a table (select only the
    earliest for any given type of cancer for any given patient). Then,
    for patients from Step 3 that do not have cancer registry entries,
    add the First-Time Diagnostic Code occurrences to that table by
    selecting only the earliest diagnostic code occurrences from Step 3.
    This table now contains the collection of Diagnosis Events within
    the study parameters.

## Exclusion

1.  From Step 4, select only records for patients who've had previous
    records in the health system for at least the Prior History Period
    (to ensure that the patients are "enrolled" in the health system).
